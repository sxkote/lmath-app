# LMath 

Application based on LBox.Shared & LBox.Auth libraries.

LBox.Shared and LBox.Auth libraries provides basic functional to build up Angular application with Authentication and Authorization based on LBox microservices.
That way, the only need for application is to build up self business-logic.

LMath is the small application to make some calculation quizes for kids and adults :)
